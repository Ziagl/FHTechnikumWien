a simulation of falling sand in an hourglass
#### Waldbrand
a forest fires simulation
#### LSystem
Lindemayer-System implementation to grow plants
### Damenproblem
eight queens puzzle with dynamic board size implemented with genetic algorithm
#### Vier Gewinnt
artificial intelligence implementation of connect four game
