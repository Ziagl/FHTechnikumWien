## Projects

### Artificial Intelligence

#### Sanduhr
a simulation of falling sand in an hourglass
#### Waldbrand
a forest fires simulation
#### LSystem
Lindemayer-System implementation to grow plants
#### Damenproblem
eight queens puzzle with dynamic board size implemented with genetic algorithm
#### Vier Gewinnt
artificial intelligence implementation of connect four game
#### AStern
an A* (A star) pathfinding algorithm implemented
#### AntColony
an implementation of ant path finding algorithm (also called ant colony optimization algorithm)
#### eSheep
a life simulation of sheeps. Each sheep has an individual genome and its actions are based on this.

### Physics

#### Fireworks
a simple particle system that simulates fireworks with physics (impulse, gravity, ...)
#### Gravity
extends fireworks physics engine with gravity and friction to collide particles with planes
#### Lunar Lander
simple game/simulation to land on the moon


### Algorithms and data structures

#### Convex Hull
simple Program to create a convex hull around a number of points in 2D space.
#### median search
implementation of different median search algorithms (randomized selection and median by Wirth)
#### kdTree
a kdTree implemention with sample program and intersection methods for ray - triangle and ray - kdTree

### Efficient programming

#### OMP
a simple Open MP sample program for first Open MP tests with C++ in Visual Studio
#### GameOfLife and GameOfLife_OMP
an implementation of Game of Life and a second version parallelized with Open MP with performance measuremnt
